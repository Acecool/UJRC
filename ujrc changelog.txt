1.0.2 28th May 2014
= If none of the active shift states apply to a button, that button will be in the default state.
  So if button 1 has shift states for "default" and "mode1", but shift mode mode2 is active...
  ...the button will be in the "default" state as "mode2" is not associated with button 1.

1.0.1 25th May 2014
= Up Event now correctly sent for Button types
