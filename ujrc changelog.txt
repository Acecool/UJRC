  Various buttons in template were not configured correctly

= TrackIR mode fixed
= TrackIR UI mode and normal mode merged. script now simpler

2.0.0 31st May 2014
* Major rewrite
= Syntax changed a little, so Configuration Scripts are not 100% backwards compatible
  Add() has changet to either AddButton() or AddShift()
= If there is a shift state which is not used by a button, then that shift state will no longer affect that button.
  eg you have a button which has no setting for "power" shift. Holding power shift will not stop that button from executing it's default action
= Improved handling for output key states.
  Only one key down or key up event is sent per *output* key per cycle.
  UJRC will no longer press and release the same button multiple times per loop, no matter what.
= Removed EDTweak from package - no longer required.
+ All key names in sample Elite script now match with in-game names
  Added most key names found in Alpha 4.1
+ Sample GIMP XCF image included for making layout images.
+ Layout image included for sample Elite layout

1.0.2 28th May 2014
= If none of the active shift states apply to a button, that button will be in the default state.
  So if button 1 has shift states for "default" and "mode1", but shift mode mode2 is active...
  ...the button will be in the "default" state as "mode2" is not associated with button 1.

= Up Event now correctly sent for Button types

1.0.0 25th May 2014
